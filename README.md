#NPReachability
###By [Nick Paulson](http://twitter.com/nckplsn)

NPReachability is a block-based reachability class.  It notifies handlers of changes in the reachability status.

To use, add *SystemConfiguration.framework* as a linked framework to your project, then just add a block as a handler!

Please use and improve!

I'd love it if you could send me a note as to which app you're using it with!
